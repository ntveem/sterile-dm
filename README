Dependencies:

1. fortran 90 compiler (tested on gfortran 4.4.7 and g95 0.93)

===============================================================================
Compilation instructions:

1. Run the configure script, passing it your fortran compiler and an
   argument specifying whether to generate debug flags (off by default)
   eg:
	# normal run
	./configure gfortran
	# run with debug flags
	./configure gfortran d

2. If you have received the code from another person/machine, and are compiling 
   it for the first time, run 'make clean'.
3. Run 'make' to generate the executable, which is named 'sterile-nu'.

===============================================================================
How to run the program:

Run the program by passing the address of the parameter file to the 
   executable:
        ./sterile-nu <name of param file>

===============================================================================
User controllable parameters:

1. Currently the code requires all the parameters specified in the example 
   parameter file provided, 'params.ini'. Modify the fields as needed.

2. Further parameters controlling the operation of the code are to be found in 
   the file 'defaults.f90' in the src folder.

===============================================================================
Data needed by the code:

The current version of the code requires the following data files, provided 
in the subfolder 'data/tables':

  a) relativistic degrees of freedom vs temperature:
     g_* and g_*,s obtained from Phys. Rev. D 73 (2006) 085009 [hep-ph/0603048]
  b) Stefan-Boltzmann particle number susceptibilities vs mass
  c) Fermi-Dirac energy densities vs mass
  d) Strongly interacting fluid's suceptibilities to fluctuations in 
     Baryon number and electric charge, vs temperature                  
  e) lepton asymmetry redistribution functions vs temperature: 
     d\mu_X/dL_{\alpha} : \alpha \in {e, \mu, \tau}, 
                          X \in \{e, \mu, \tau, \nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau, Q, B\}
  f) neutrino opacities \Gamma(p,T) in units of G_F^2 T^5, as a function of 
     temperature scaled momentum p/T and temperature T

See our paper at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06655 for more details on these 
parameters, and the treatment of the sterile neutrino production

===============================================================================
Output format:

The code creates a new output sub-directory within 'outfiles' for each run, i.e. 
unique set of parameters (m_s, \sin^2\theta, and optionally L) via the function
'ODE_output' in the file 'odeinterface.f90'. Generally, the output directory 
consists of three sets of files:
  1. A parameter file 'params.dat', which contains the mass, mixing angle, 
     initial lepton asymmetry (in units of the photon density) and the sterile 
     neutrino closure fraction.
  2. A state file, 'state.dat', which contains the temperature, FRW coordinate 
     time, number of e-folds since the starting temperature, lepton asymmetry 
     and DM closure fraction for all temperatures at which the state is saved 
     (the variable 'INTFLAG' is provided to output at NSAVE_MAX logarithmically
     spaced temperatures, if needed)
  3. A set of snapshot files, one for each line in the state file. They contain 
     the sterile neutrino and anti-neutrino p.s.ds
